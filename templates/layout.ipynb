    "This HTML template is a basic structure often used in web applications with Jinja (or similar templating engines) to allow for dynamic content and reusable layouts. Let's go over each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "    <title>\n",
    "        {% block title %}\n",
    "            Household Services\n",
    "        {% endblock %}\n",
    "    </title>\n",
    "    {% block style %}\n",
    "    {% endblock %}\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    {% block content %}\n",
    "    {% endblock %}\n",
    "    {% block script %}\n",
    "    {% endblock %}\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**  \n",
    "   This line defines the document type, specifying that this is an HTML5 document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`<html lang=\"en\">`**  \n",
    "   This tag defines the language of the document as English (`en`). Setting the language helps with accessibility and SEO, allowing screen readers and search engines to better interpret the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`<head>`**  \n",
    "   The `<head>` section contains metadata (data about data) that is not directly visible on the webpage but is essential for the browser and search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">`**  \n",
    "     Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">`**  \n",
    "     This tag ensures that the layout adjusts to different screen sizes, especially important for mobile devices. It sets the viewport width to match the device's width and scales the content accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`<title>...{% block title %}...{% endblock %}</title>`**  \n",
    "   - The `<title>` tag defines the title of the webpage displayed in the browser tab or window.\n",
    "   - **`{% block title %} ... {% endblock %}`**  \n",
    "     This Jinja block allows child templates to replace the default title (`Household Services`) with a page-specific title. When a child template overrides this block, it can set its own title, keeping each pageâ€™s title dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`{% block style %}...{% endblock %}`**  \n",
    "   This block is for including page-specific CSS styles. By default, it's empty, but child templates can add custom styles here. Placing it in the `<head>` section ensures that styles load before the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`<body>...{% block content %}...{% endblock %}</body>`**  \n",
    "   - The `<body>` tag contains the visible content of the webpage.\n",
    "   - **`{% block content %} ... {% endblock %}`**  \n",
    "     This main content block is where each child template would place its page-specific content (e.g., text, images, or any other HTML elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`{% block script %}...{% endblock %}`**  \n",
    "   This block is reserved for JavaScript. By placing it at the end of the `<body>`, scripts can load after the content, improving page load speed and user experience. Like the style block, this one is empty by default but can be overridden in child templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This template serves as a **base layout** for other pages in your application, allowing child templates to:\n",
    "- Set unique page titles.\n",
    "- Add custom CSS or JavaScript.\n",
    "- Insert specific page content.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this structure, you ensure consistency across pages and make it easy to manage and update the layout from one central file."
